# Parallel-Programming
Project developed in the Parallel Programing part of the "G653 Parallel, Concurrent and Real Time Programming" course of the Computer Systems Engineering degree.
Project final grade: 9,75/10

There are 4 practices, the first one developed in C++ with the Posix library in order to simulate the optimizations that OpenMP would do, and the other ones are given C codes optimizated directly with OpenMP resources. Full details of the analysis, the optimization process and some answers to given questions are available in the report file.
For each practice, there may be some Python scripts developed to obtain the execution times of the main programs and represent them in graphs.
